    "Motivation: There are many kinds of channels in a neuron, grouped by the types of ions that flow through them. Many of them fall into the category of voltage-gated ion channels, like the sodium and potassium channels in the original HH equations. There are also ion-gated channels, such as calcium-gated potassium channels. To simulate such channels, it's important to model how the local calcium concentration, $[Ca^{2+}]$, changes in response to neuronal activity.\n",
